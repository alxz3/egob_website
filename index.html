                    <h4 class="text-xl md:text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">The Corporate Schism</h4>
                    <p class="text-base leading-relaxed">
                        Before their reputation as ruthless space marauders, the Evil Space Goblins were not a race, but a corporate entity known as "Goblinworks Tech & Salvage." Operating as a minor, yet highly innovative, subsidiary within a major galactic coalition, they specialized in "unconventional" engineering and salvage operations in high-risk zones. Their knack for turning battlefield scrap into high-performance weaponry and their audacious, no-rules approach to resource acquisition made them a nuisance to the more bureaucratic, risk-averse alliances.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-base leading-relaxed mt-4">
                        The schism began when a joint-venture contract with an alliance went sour. Seeking to acquire Goblinworks' proprietary warp-drive technology and changing their way to life fundamentaly. When the Goblins refused to follow up on the demands, the contract was declared void. With no secure way to access their assets and having their leadership branded as renegades, they were forced to abandon once-friendly areas entirely.

                    <h4 class="text-xl md:text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">Tactics and Technology</h4>
                    <p class="text-base leading-relaxed">
                        The Goblins' combat doctrine is a direct reflection of their origins. While other corporations and alliances field massive, ponderous capital ships, the Evil Space Goblins rely on guerilla tactics. They utilize fleets of small, highly-agile ships, a modern take on the classic goblin horde. These ships are custom-built, making them unpredictable and difficult for standard tactics to track and shoot. Their weaponry often consists of improvised energy-based systems and explosive projectiles designed to bypass the hardened shields of larger ships and strike at their vital subsystems. A single Goblin ship may not be a threat, but a coordinated swarm can overwhelm even the most powerful dreadnought.

                    <p class="text-base leading-relaxed">
                        The Goblins' unyielding resolve is not just a matter of spirit. They have perfected their own brutal form of personal resurrection, a process they call "Re-Cloning." Unlike the sterile, pristine clones of the galaxy, the Goblins' version is a quick and dirty process that is more akin to a forced rebirth. A veteran who falls in combat is quickly returned to a combat-ready state, but their body often bears new scars, and their memories of the final moments of their demise are seared into their minds. To the Goblins, these scars are not a flaw but a testament to their resilience—a record of every dirty uniform and every hard-fought victory.

                    <p class="text-base leading-relaxed">
                        Led by Nyx, part of the Goblins executed a desperate exodus, moving into the deepest, most unstable regions of the galaxy. They found refuge in a series of interconnected, uncharted wormhole systems—a realm of chaotic spatial anomalies and unpredictable celestial phenomena. This lawless frontier, shunned by others, became their home.
                    </p>
                    <p class="text-base leading-relaxed mt-4">
                        Within this dangerous realm, they built their new home from the ground up. Survival demanded a pragmatic and cutthroat mindset, and their original corporate motto—a dry-witted jab at their rivals—transformed into a creed: "Can't be nice to everybody." This philosophy defines their culture; they are fiercely loyal to their own but show no quarter to outsiders, who they view as either a threat or a resource.

                    <p class="text-base leading-relaxed">
                        While a part of the Goblins joined the Wormhole Frontier, another part, led by Atlas, deployed into Syndicate region. A notorious lawless hub of mercenary activity and black market trade, Syndicate was a testing ground. Still in contact with the Wormhole Frontier, “Can’t be nice to everybody” philosophy also reached Syndicate. The Goblins were eager to disrupt the supply lines of their enemies. Deploying their swarm tactics, the Goblins wreaked havoc on enemy pilots and industrialists. They proved that their salvaged ships and unorthodox methods could stand up to and even defeat the most expensive, state-of-the-art combat vessels. This campaign cemented their reputation as a force to be feared and expanded their influence across the lawless sectors of New Eden.

A veteran of countless skirmishes, her cheerful demeanor masks a fierce cunning and an unwavering loyalty to her comrades.

She has vibrant green skin and sharp, pointed ears, with a modern side-cut hairstyle of brunette hair that fades to green at the very end. A small, stylized skull tattoo adorns her side, just above the waistband of her uniform. Her uniform is a shiny, form-fitting, dark-green military outfit with a latex-like appearance. It features a high collar and prominent black-silverish armor elements, with a small corset and breast cutout. A sidearm is always holstered at her hip, ready for whatever the galaxy throws at them.</p>

He wears a similar, but more heavily armored, uniform to Nyx. It is a form-fitting, shiny, dark-green military outfit with a high collar and prominent, heavy-duty shoulder pads. Unlike Nyx, his uniform is a full one-piece with a utility belt that has a few tactical pouches and a small knife holster. He is never seen without his massive, two-handed energy hammer, which hums with a faint violet glow.</p>
